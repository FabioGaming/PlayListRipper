# PlayListRipper
### PlayListRipper is a little tool I created to Download YouTube Videos and PlayLists.

#### This Project is Powered by [YouTubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode), [YouTubeExplode.Converter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/YoutubeExplode.Converter) and [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org)

## How it works
Once you run the program, you are prompted to select the type of Media you want to download (Video / PlayList), the options marked with (AUDIO) will download the given link as .mp3 files
## Where can I access my files?
The Files will be stored on `Desktop/PlayListRipper` in case you download a PlayList, they will be saved in `Desktop/PlayListRipper/PlayListName/`
## What platform is this made for?
PlayListRipper currently only runs on Windows, a linux version will follow soon.

# IMPORTANT
Since this project is made using [YouTubeExplode.Converter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/YoutubeExplode.Converter) you will **need** [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org) which can be downloaded [HERE](https://ffbinaries.com/downloads)
If you're unsure if you have `FFPMEG` installed, you can press `Win + R` and type `cmd`, inside of the command prompt you can try to type `ffmpeg`.
